Core PHP project

Hello!
This project was made using core oop php. It uses mini MVC framework that I have made.

Design was taken from colorlib and it uses Materialzie dashboard for admin area.

In this app, users can see courses, register and login and apply for courses. 
Unauthenticated users can send inquiry for courses that they are interested in.

Admin will create courses, create teachers, assign courses to teachers, see applications and see inquiries.

Thank you!
